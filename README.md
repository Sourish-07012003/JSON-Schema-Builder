This is a ReactJS-based JSON Schema Builder built as part of the **HROne Frontend Intern Hiring Task**. The application allows users to dynamically create and manage a JSON schema by adding, editing, deleting, and nesting fields. It uses **React Hook Form** for form management and **Ant Design** (or ShadCN UI) for UI components.
